This project was my initial effort to learn M.E.A.N stack and deploy with Heroku. It currently is not deployed on www.skalarly.com, but I still own that domain name.
This project currently has some errors as it was used more for creating a rough framework for future capabilities. This framework is now being constructed in skalarly-fs, which follows proper practices and industry standards. 
This repository displays years of learning, which is why some files may look elementary, or fall short of proper practices. Where as other files/code will display my efforts after I acquired more knowledge on the given topic.
Instead of going back and restructuing the entire project and updating to the capabilities of Angular 16 and soon 17. I decided it would be more efficent to restart the project with all standalone components and follow reusable coding techniques. 
I will continue to transfer the code in this repository to the new skalarly-fs, but will modify it to the standards and efficency that I am now aware of.
